# Acknowledgments

This book would not have been possible without the support of my family, who are incredibly patient with me when I get absorbed with yet another side project.

Special thanks go to Matthew Powers, a.k.a. Mr. Powers, for inspiring me to write this book in the first place. Matthew is the author of the book "Writing Beautiful Apache Spark Code" which is also available on Leanpub.

I also need to thank the countless people who have interacted with me over the past couple of years as I worked on the DataFusion project, especially the Apache Arrow PMC, committers, and contributors.

Finally, I want to thank Chris George and Joe Buszkiewic for their support and encouragement while working at RMS, where I further developed my understanding of query engines.
